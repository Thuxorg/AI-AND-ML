# Chicken Health Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is a **Chicken Health Monitoring System** designed to monitor the health and activities of chickens in a farm environment. It uses a deep learning model to detect chicken health based on visual input from an IP camera. The system can notify the owner in case of inactivity or sickness, and it ensures the chickens have access to food, water, and eggs. This system aims to improve the efficiency of farm management by automating health checks and alerts.

## Features
- **Health Monitoring:** Detects whether chickens are sick or inactive based on the visual feed from an IP camera.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Sends notifications if any chickens are inactive, sick, or if food and water are running low.
- **IP Camera Integration:** The system can directly process video feeds from an IP camera.
- **Egg, Food, and Water Check:** Ensures that eggs, food, and water are available for the chickens.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
